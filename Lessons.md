# Lessons

This file will be a repository of where I will store things that I have learned 
during this challenge.

* Make sure to explore both the train and the test dataset in conjuction for missing data
* One-hot encoding does not handle missing data very well,  I had to hack the training feature set since the test set had a single new value in Parch that did not appear in the training data 
* Mke sure you have fully explorered and understood the dataset
    
# Specific

* I treated SibSp and Parch as non linear discrete values but this may not be an appropriate choice.
* Take a look at an interaction feature between age and fare
* Check out decision trees as the model.  That would probably handle the data better.
