This is my attempt to tackle to introductory kaggle competition Titanic.

**TODO**:
* Why is my model overfitting but the cv score is high?
* Fit age using a gaussian distribution.
* Combine SibSp and Parch into single value.
* Use grid search cv to tune hyper parameters.
* Check performance between using 1-hot in tree vs not.
* Check out XGBoost model.
